# Here is few pointers for this application:

1. Architecture used: MVVM with Repository Pattern
2. Dependency injection used: Dagger2
3. Architected using Kotlin DSL
4. Edge cases handled:
- Unauthenticated user
- Any public repository access and it's closed pull requests
- Choice to navigate view PR according to repository
- Internet check
- Important note - Pushing of actual GitHub Auth Token is restricted hence if you want to clone this repository, you need to add your person token to BuildSrc'sÂ Dependency file.
